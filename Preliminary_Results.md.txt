## Left to Do

### Molecular fingerprint as an independent variable

The orginal plan was to determine the molecular fingerprint from the chemical structure of each drug and include it as an independent variable. This has not yet been implemented.

### Improve the completeness of the datset

The dataset was assembled by combining three different datasets. This was performed by joining on text strings, which resulted in loss of data. It might be possible to use fuzzy matching to reduce data loss.

### Run the model for a different time period

The model was perfomed on only the most recent 5 years of data to test the performance and to limit processing time for the preliminary results.
